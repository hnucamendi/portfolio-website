# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Hnucamend
**Date:** 2026-02-22

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Voter information SPA for politics.hnucamendi.com
**Goals:** Design a modern, non-biased civic tech SPA with interactive ballot UI, candidate deep-dives, district/state political impact analytics, and Ground News integration — starting small and building incrementally

### Session Setup

- Standalone SPA living in existing portfolio repo, routed to politics.hnucamendi.com
- Core features: next voting/early voting dates, candidate info, ballot preview
- Information hierarchy: federal → state → district
- Interactive ballot-style UI where each item links to candidate deep-dive
- Stats showing how district/state affects greater politics (swing state, safe state, per-vote impact)
- Non-biased presentation; Ground News for all candidate/event news
- Personal use, not commercial; start small, modernize incrementally

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Civic tech product design — new SPA from scratch with UX + data architecture decisions

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **First Principles Thinking:** Strip assumptions about what voting info apps should do and rebuild from what voters fundamentally need — anchors the non-bias and modernization goals
- **What If Scenarios:** Divergent feature and UX ideation without constraints — generates the idea volume needed for a rich product concept
- **SCAMPER Method:** Systematically refine the feature list across 7 lenses to find MVP scope and defer future work cleanly

**AI Rationale:** This sequence moves from foundational clarity → expansive ideation → actionable scope, matching the user's goal of starting small while thinking ambitiously.
