          <h2>Hello World!</h2>
          <p>
            I was born in Mexico, raised in the United States. I have always
            loved gaming, I played Little Big Planet, The God of war series,
            Call of Duty, Skyrim, Minecraft etc... And that love for gaming
            eventually grew into a curiousity for gaming mechanics. around 2016
            I started to really research how games were made and I started
            learning Java to make Minecraft Mods; although it wasn't until 2018
            when I made my first mod, all it did was add new tools and some farm
            items and blocks. From this I decided I wanted to do more, so I went
            into a coding bootcamp and I knew I had found my passion for
            programming.
